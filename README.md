# DITADictionary
Translate the OASIS DITA specification into a reference guide your authors can use.

##Why is this necessary? 
* The OASIS DITA spec was not written for you - it was written for DITA tool creators.
* Your authors need to know what elements and attributes to use when, where, and why. 
* You should document the elements and attributes you use as part of your Documentation Handbook.

##What does the dictionary include? 
* Commonly used elements in alphabetical order or other categorization that makes sense for your team.
* An index based on authoring tasks.
* Reuse from or links to other internal procedures or strategies.

## How to Get Started
1. Start small! Decide what tags you **know** you're going to definitely use and list them.
2. Read the DITA specs about each of these tags.
3. Determine how, when, and why these tags should be used.
4. Determine how they fit into your document procedures -- e.g., linking or reuse strategies or SEO activities.
5. Use your authoring tool to document each element or attribute, ensuring all internal procedures are being followed. 
6. Use the template (provided) to provide informatoin about the element or attribute and how it's used on your team. DO NOT copy and paste the spec!
7. If an element has required or optional attributes, document those as well. 
8. Provide real, concrete, and replicatable examples, both using the elements in the source and showing the raw code (such as in a <screen> tag). Those using this information outside the source will thank you (some elements are invisible)!
9. Use this guide to train and guide new writers.
10. Edit, refine, update. Elements you decide on today may change or evolve 2 years from now.
