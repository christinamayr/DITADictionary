# DITADictionary
Translate the OASIS DITA specification into a reference guide your authors can use.

##Why is the dictionary necessary? 
* The OASIS DITA spec was not written for you - it was written for DITA tool creators.
* Your authors need to know what elements and attributes to use when, where, and why. 
* Some tags seem to serve the same purpose. Your job is to provide information about which ones were chosen and how they are used.
* You should document the elements and attributes you use as part of your Documentation Handbook.

##What does the dictionary include? 
* All elements used elements in alphabetical order or other categorization that makes sense for your team.
* A "commonly used" or "how do I..." topic at the beginning. 
* An index based on authoring tasks.
* Reuse from or links to other internal procedures or strategies.

## How do I get started?
1. Start small! Decide what tags you **know** you're going to use first and list them.
2. Read the DITA specs about each of these tags.
3. Document how, when, and why these tags should be used and how they will be formatted in your outputs.
4. Determine how they fit into your document procedures -- e.g., linking or reuse strategies or SEO activities.
5. Use your authoring tool to document each element or attribute, ensuring all internal procedures are being followed. 
6. Use the template (provided) to provide informatoin about the element or attribute and how it's used on your team. DO NOT copy and paste the spec!
7. Put all your tags together in a map or bookmap.
8. Distribute to your team to gather and incorporate feedback.
9. Use the dictionary to train and guide new writers.
10. Edit, refine, update. Elements you decide on today may change or evolve 2 years from now. This is an iterative document.

## Best Practices
* You don't have to use every tag (in fact, you won't), so don't try to rewrite the spec. Start with what needs clarification or has special usage.
* Avoid documenting the "how" of using elements. That's better for a procedural guide.
* If an element has required or optional attributes, say which ones should be used and why/what it does. Reuse attribute defintions wherever possible.
* Provide real, concrete, and replicatable examples, both using the elements in the source and showing the raw code (such as in a <screen> tag). Those using this information outside the source will thank you (some elements are invisible)!
* Some elements are used as a pair or are closely related, so be sure to use related links or relationship tables to show those relationships.
